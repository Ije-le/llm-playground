Susan Hengeveld, a seasoned ornithologist at Yellowwood State Forest in Brown County, Indiana, spends each fall rescuing, banding, and releasing tiny Northern Saw‑Whet Owls caught in fine mesh nets.  After gently freeing each bird, she records its weight, wingspan, sex and a unique metal band before handing the owl to a novice volunteer for the final release—a ritual she believes forges a lasting, emotional connection to the species.  Her meticulous, long‑term dataset—now spanning more than a decade—has revealed that these secretive, nocturnal owls migrate far beyond the range once assumed, moving in all directions rather than simply heading south.

Before turning to owls, Susan earned a Ph.D. studying frog vocalizations before shifting to birdsong, eventually becoming a professor and director of undergraduate biology at Indiana University.  Her fascination with avian communication and a childhood love of northern Minnesota’s birdlife led her to the Saw‑Whet, whose silent, bark‑brown flight had long puzzled researchers.  Taking over Indiana’s first banding station in 2010, she and her husband Jim have built a collaborative program that draws students, volunteers, and even family members into night‑time field work, using audio lures and painstaking net checks to capture the owls in the pitch‑black forest.

The nightly routine is a blend of science and sensory challenge: Susan relies on hearing aids to catch the faint calls, while occasional equipment failures force her to depend on the younger ears of her crew.  As the season winds down in December, she reflects on the importance of passing the torch—training newcomers, keeping the data stream alive, and ensuring that the tiny owls continue to be studied long after she retires.  Each captured bird, each band, and each release is a small but vital piece of a larger puzzle that deepens our understanding of migration, ecology, and the profound bond between people and the wild.
